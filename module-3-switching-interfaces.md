# Module 3: Configuring Interfaces and Switches

## Learning Objectives
- Explain network interfaces and Ethernet switching
- Deploy switching features and troubleshoot issues

## Key Topics
- **NICs vs Transceivers**: NIC connects host to network; transceivers adapt media types
- **Ethernet Frame Format**: MAC source/destination, payload, FCS
- **Switching Devices**: Hubs (broadcast), Bridges (segment), Switches (filter MAC)
- **Switch Features**: STP, MTU, Link Aggregation, PoE
- **Troubleshooting**: Interface counters, port lights, PoE failure, loops
