# CompTIA Network+ - Module 1 Notes

## ðŸ“˜ Module 1: Explaining Network Topologies

---

### âœ… Learning Objectives
- Explain network types and characteristics.
- Compare and contrast OSI model layers.
- Configure SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) networks.
- Explain and apply CompTIAâ€™s troubleshooting methodology.

### ðŸ§© Lesson 1.1: Networking Overview

#### ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts:
- A **network** is a group of connected devices sharing data (includes computers, protocols, and transmission media).
- **Peer-to-peer**: Devices communicate directly.
- **Client-server**: Central server provides services to multiple clients.
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: A network confined to a single physical location (e.g., home or office).

#### ðŸ”Œ Network Topologies:
- **Point-to-Point**: Two nodes communicate directly.
- **Star**: All nodes connect to a central point (e.g., a switch).
- **Mesh**: Devices are interconnected (partial or full mesh), offering redundancy.

### ðŸ“Š Lesson 1.2: OSI Model Concepts

#### ðŸ§± OSI 7-Layer Model (Mnemonic: **All People Seem To Need Data Processing**):
1. **Application** â€“ Interface for applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP).
2. **Presentation** â€“ Translates, encrypts, compresses data.
3. **Session** â€“ Manages sessions and authentication.
4. **Transport** â€“ Reliable delivery (TCP/UDP).
5. **Network** â€“ Logical addressing and routing (IP).
6. **Data Link** â€“ MAC addressing, switching (Ethernet).
7. **Physical** â€“ Hardware, cables, signals.

#### ðŸ“¦ Packet Flow:
- Data is **encapsulated** at each layer on the sender side and **decapsulated** on the receiver side.

### ðŸ–§ Lesson 1.3: SOHO Networks

#### ðŸ›  SOHO Router Layer Functions:
- **Physical Layer**: Connects cables and ports.
- **Data Link Layer**: Switch and Wi-Fi; devices identified by MAC addresses.
- **Network Layer**: Routes between LAN and public internet; acts as DHCP server.
- **Transport & Application Layers**: Provides NAT, port forwarding, and web services.
- **Internet Integration**: WAN connection to ISP and beyond.

#### ðŸ”¢ Binary & Hex:
- Understanding base-10 and binary systems is essential for IP addressing.
- Example: Converting 205 and 132 into binary.

### ðŸ”§ Lesson 1.4: Troubleshooting Methodology

#### ðŸ›  Steps:
1. **Identify the Problem** â€“ Gather details.
2. **Identify Problem Symptoms** â€“ What exactly is failing?
3. **Establish a Theory** â€“ Make an educated guess.
4. **Test the Theory** â€“ Validate or eliminate possible causes.
5. **Implement a Solution** â€“ Fix the issue.
6. **Verify Functionality** â€“ Make sure it works.
7. **Document Findings** â€“ Write down the issue, solution, and impact.

#### ðŸ§  Techniques:
- **Top-to-Bottom**: Start at Application layer and work down.
- **Bottom-to-Top**: Start at Physical and work up.
- **Divide-and-Conquer**: Test the middle layer and move up/down based on results.

### ðŸ“Œ Summary
- The **OSI Model** helps with understanding and troubleshooting network communication.
- Use a **structured troubleshooting process** to solve network problems.
- Understand **network topologies** and the role of SOHO routers.
- Know how to **convert between binary and decimal** for IP calculations.
