- TCP (Transport layer): Connection-oriented protocol with acknowledgments for guaranteed delivery.
- DHCP: Automatically assigns IP settings (address, mask, gateway, DNS).
- DHCP relay agents forward traffic across subnets.
- DNS: Hierarchical, distributed database resolving domains and hostnames.
