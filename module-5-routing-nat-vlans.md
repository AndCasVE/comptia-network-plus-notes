# Module 5: Routing, NAT, and VLANs

- Routing tables store IP network and host location data.
- Dynamic routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP) enable efficient information exchange.
- NAT allows private/public IP communication management.
- VLANs: Create separate logical networks within a single physical infrastructure.
