# Module 3: Network Devices

- NICs connect hosts to the transmission medium; transceivers terminate various cable and connector types.
- Device behavior:
  - Hubs: Broadcast data to all ports.
  - Switches: Send data to the destination port only.
  - Bridges: Divide physical segments but maintain the same logical network.
- STP (Spanning Tree Protocol): A Layer 2 protocol that prevents loops and ensures network fault tolerance.
